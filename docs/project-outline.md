Here’s the outline of your program based on your requests, structured in a **Markdown file** format. This outline will help the AI coding tool understand the workflow and implement the program step-by-step.

# **Program Outline**

## **1. Overview**
The program will:
1. Automatically navigate to a webpage using Selenium.
2. Use a `cookies.json` file to maintain the session.
3. Capture a full-page screenshot of the webpage.
4. Upload the screenshot to a specified folder in Google Drive.
5. Retrieve metadata (e.g., title, screenshot link) from the webpage and Google Drive.
6. Update the Google Sheet with the retrieved metadata in the next column of the URL.

---

## **2. Workflow**
### **Step 1: Read Input**
- Read the URL from a specified column in a Google Sheet.
- Load environment variables from `.env` (e.g., Google Drive folder ID, path to `cookies.json`).

### **Step 2: Initialize Selenium**
- Set up Selenium with Chrome in headless mode for faster execution.
- Load cookies from `cookies.json` to maintain the session.

### **Step 3: Navigate to the Webpage**
- Navigate to the URL using Selenium.
- Wait for the page to load completely.

### **Step 4: Capture Full-Page Screenshot**
- Use Selenium to capture a full-page screenshot.
- Save the screenshot locally with a unique filename.

### **Step 5: Upload Screenshot to Google Drive**
- Use the Google Drive API to upload the screenshot to the specified folder.
- Retrieve the file ID and shareable link of the uploaded screenshot.

### **Step 6: Retrieve Metadata**
- Extract metadata from the webpage (e.g., title).
- Retrieve metadata from Google Drive (e.g., file ID, thumbnail link).

### **Step 7: Update Google Sheet**
- Write the retrieved metadata (e.g., title, screenshot link) to the next column of the URL in the Google Sheet.

### **Step 8: Error Handling**
- Log errors (e.g., failed uploads, invalid URLs) to `error_logs.txt`.
- Stop execution if an error occurs.

## **4. Key Features**
### **Selenium Automation**
- Use Chrome in headless mode for faster execution.
- Load cookies from `cookies.json` to maintain the session.
- Capture full-page screenshots using Selenium’s `execute_cdp_cmd`.

### **Google Drive Integration**
- Upload screenshots to a specified folder using the Google Drive API.
- Retrieve metadata (e.g., file ID, thumbnail link) after uploading.

### **Google Sheets Integration**
- Read URLs from a specified column in the Google Sheet.
- Write metadata (e.g., title, screenshot link) to the next column.

### **Error Handling**
- Log errors to `error_logs.txt` for debugging.
- Stop execution if an error occurs.

## **5. Best Practices**
1. **Modular Code Design**:
   - Break the program into reusable functions (e.g., `capture_screenshot`, `upload_to_gdrive`, `retrieve_metadata`).
2. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Use `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for asynchronous tasks (e.g., uploading files, making API calls).
3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Store sensitive data (e.g., Google Drive folder ID, API keys) in the `.env` file.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Use `try-except` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
5. **Logging**:
   - Log all activities and errors to `error_logs.txt` for debugging.

## **6. Next Steps**
1. Provide this outline to the AI coding tool.
2. Ask the AI to implement each module step-by-step (e.g., Selenium functions first, then Google Drive functions).
3. Test the program incrementally and refine the prompts as needed.
